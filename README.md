## Introduction

KryptChat is a privacy-oriented chat platform that aims to protect users' conversations from unauthorized access. It achieves this by implementing end-to-end encryption for messages using a user-provided keycode. Additionally, chat rooms are secured using the RSA encryption algorithm, adding an extra layer of security to the communication process.

## Features

1. **Encrypted Chat Box:** KryptChat features an encrypted chat box that encrypts messages using a user-provided keycode, ensuring that only the intended recipient can decipher the messages.

2. **Secure Chat Rooms:** The chat rooms in KryptChat are encrypted with RSA, making the server more secure and safeguarding users' data.

## Technologies Used

KryptChat utilizes the following technologies to deliver a secure chat platform:

- NodeJS
- Express
- Socket.IO
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- RSA Encryption

## Installation

To set up KryptChat locally on your machine, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mvaibhav77/kryptchat.git
   cd kryptchat
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   # Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   KryptChat may require certain environment variables for configuration. Check for a `.env` file in the root of the project and ensure it contains the necessary variables, if any.

4. **Start the Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

KryptChat provides a secure and private chat experience for its users. Upon visiting the website, users can:
